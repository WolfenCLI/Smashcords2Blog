# Smashcords Blog
Welcome to the Smashcords blogs. Here you can find informations about a specific character. The information on this website is maintained directly from the respective Smashcord admins through the [Smashcords2Blog open source bot](https://github.com/WolfenCLI/Smashcords2Blog).  

You can also browse the categories and posts using the menu on the left.

### Where to find the other character's blogs
Each Discord is responsible for where to share their own link but generally you can replace the character name in the URL and, if said Discord has agreed to using this bot, you will go to their homepage.

### I'm a Discord admin and I want my blog
The bot is open source and everyone is free to host their own and edit the code.  
This bot will also be hosted by the maintainer. You can find them on Discord as "Sesilaso üêæ#0929". The "official" bot is only meant for Smashcords.

# Smashcords2Blog
Discord Bot developed for Smashcords to archive messages in a static blog

### Deploy the blog
This bot creates .md files to be built with hugo into a blog.  
I personally used the following theme: [Codex](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-codex/)  
To move and build the files I use a script on a crontab every 15 minutes.
